# Letter-Sorter
Admission and Scholarship letter sorting console app.

To test the application: 
1): Copy the included "CombinedLetters" folder in "Test Files" to the Desktop.
2): Go to "Input\Admission" & "Input\Scholarship" folders and change the dated folder to the current date (e.g. 20230822).
Run the application and review the copied test folder for changes.

To test larger sets of files, I recommend creating a PowerShell script, or a test method which generates hundreds of admission and scholarship letters.
